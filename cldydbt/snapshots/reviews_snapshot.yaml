#Note, in v1.9 and higher, the hard_deletes config replaces the invalidate_hard_deletes config for 
#better control over how to handle deleted rows from the source.
#Use the hard_deletes config to track deleted records as new rows with the dbt_is_deleted meta 
#field when using the hard_deletes='new_record' field.
